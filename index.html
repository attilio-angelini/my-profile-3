  			<h2>Relevant Business experience: </h2>
				<h3>Deutsche Bank - Summer Analyst </h3>
					<p>I worked in Milan in the investment banking division of Deutsche Bank, as a summer analysts of the advisory team for M&A. I helped creating different company profiles based on the financial statements of the companies using both Excel and Powerpoint. I also helped analysts with research on several areas such as investment companies, SPACs,IPO’s, etc. I worked mostly on Italian pharmaceutical, fashion and airline companies.</p>

				<h3> Western Union - Summer stage, Sales department </h3>
					<p> I rotated between London local shops in outskirts, learning how the international business operates and convincing new shops to choose WU as a provider of remittances. I achieved a conversion rate of 19%. Applying economics studies on oligopoly, where grass- root advertisement is more powerful than pricing to win clients, due to strategic incentives. In this experience, I employed linguistic skills across a variety of divisions, helping translate complex information in an easily palatable format. Translated a consultant’s recommendation report for the Madrid office.</p>

				<h3>Student Investor Challenge </h3>
					<p> Student Investor Challenge is a leading online trading competition for IB students. My team and I, were the school-winner of the competition after employing a stock-picking strategy based on both a graphical and a technical analysis of the stock, trying to distinguish market momentum from underlying fundamentals, and using this information to select amongst the top bought, and top sold stocks.</p>
